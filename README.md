# FMCord

FMCord is a Discord bot with a large variety of Last.fm related utilities and commands. Currently, the bot can:

- Create varying album charts
- Tell you what artists you have in similar with other users
- Fetch searched tracks from YouTube
- Show the current song(s) you're playing
- Show you a list of your favorite artists/songs
Other minor commands exist as well, and more are being planned

FMCord also has small moderation support which allows admins/mods to disable certain commands on a channel or whole server. It also allows you to customize bot's prefix in your guild. Get started by typing &help --manual!

FMCord is written in a TypeScript language. The libraries for development used are:
- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) - for interaction with Discord API
- [moment.js](https://momentjs.com) - For DateTime manipulation
- [node-canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) - for image manipulation
