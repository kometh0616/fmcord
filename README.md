# FMCord

FMCord is a Discord bot with a large variety of Last.fm related utilities and commands. Currently, the bot can:

- Create varying album charts
- Tell you what artists you have in similar with other users
- Tell who has the most plays of a certain artist
- Show you what artists you have the most listens of in a server
- Give you the number of tracks you have played in last 24h hours
- Fetch searched tracks from YouTube
- Show the current song(s) you're playing
- Create a crown hierarchy system in your server
- Show you a list of your favorite artists/songs
Other minor commands exist as well, and more are being planned

FMCord also has small moderation support which allows admins/mods to disable certain commands on a channel or whole server. Get started by typing &help --manual!
